# This class is an implementation of the DAO interface for JSON files.

# - get_projects_by_teacher(teacher: Teacher) -> list[Project] .
# To do this, the program needs to cycle through the subfolders within the directory data/projects and look at the users.json files and see if the teacher is in there
#
# - save_project(teacher: Teacher, project: Project) -> None .
# To do this, the program needs to create a new subfolder in data/projects with the name of the project and save the users.json file in there.
# Since we just created the project, we make the users.json file with the teacher as the only user in it.
